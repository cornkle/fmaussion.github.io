I like to write code, and I like to get involved in the open-source software
community. Here is a list of the few projects I contribute to
(when I don't have other things to do):

### OGGM

[OGGM](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm) is an open source glacier model written
in python. It is still in an early development stage but this project has a
great potential. Among other things, OGGM participated to the
[Ice Thickness Models Intercomparison eXperiment](http://oggm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/itmix.html).

### Salem

[Salem](https://github.com/fmaussion/salem) is a small python library to do some
GIS stuff that I needed to get done. Together with [Cleo](https://github.com/fmaussion/cleo),
they provide a framework to read, analyse, and plot geoscientific data.


### DownGlacier

[DownGlacier](https://bitbucket.org/fmaussion/downglacier) is an empirical
statistical downscaling (ESD) tool developed to retrieve glacier Surface
Energy and Mass Balance (SEB/SMB) fluxes from large-scale atmospheric data.
It was developed to extend measured (or modelled) SEB/SMB timeseries
to longer time periods in a semi-automated manner.

### Other projects

I also made modest contributions to the following projects:

- [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray), an awesome library to handle multi-dimensional arrays
- [motionless](https://github.com/ryancox/motionless), a tool to generate static google maps
- [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib), python's most famous plotting library

In times not so far away I used to develop a bunch of tools with
[IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_%28programming_language%29), which are
available on request. My very first experience with open-source was for
my master thesis, during which I had the chance to participate to the development
of [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org/).
