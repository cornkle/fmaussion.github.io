I like writing code and getting involved in open-source software development.
Here is a list of the projects I contribute to:

### OGGM

[OGGM](http://oggm.org) is an open source glacier model written
in python. Among other things, OGGM participated to the
[Ice Thickness Models Intercomparison eXperiment](http://fabienmaussion.info/2016/06/18/itmix-experiment-phase1/).

### xarray

[xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org), is a Python library to handle labeled,
multi-dimensional datasets widely used in the geosciences.

### Salem

[Salem](http://salem.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a small Python library to do
geoscientific data processing and plotting. It extends
[xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) to add
geolocalised subsetting, masking, and plotting operations to xarrayâ€™s
DataArray and DataSet structures.

### DownGlacier

[DownGlacier](https://bitbucket.org/fmaussion/downglacier) is an empirical
statistical downscaling (ESD) tool developed to retrieve glacier Surface
Energy and Mass Balance (SEB/SMB) fluxes from large-scale atmospheric data.
It can extend measured (or modelled) SEB/SMB timeseries
to longer time periods in a semi-automated manner.

### motionless

[motionless](https://github.com/ryancox/motionless) is a Python library that
takes the pain out of generating Google Static Map URLs.

### Other projects

See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/fmaussion) for other projects I contribute to.

In times not so far away I used to develop a bunch of tools with
[IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_%28programming_language%29), which are
available on request. My very first experience with open-source was for
my master thesis, during which I had the chance to participate to the development
of [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org/), an orbital dynamics library written in Java.
