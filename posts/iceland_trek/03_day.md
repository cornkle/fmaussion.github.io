## Skeiðarárjökull – Graenalon

We wake up to warm sunshine from a completely blue sky. Again, no wind has
tested our provisionally pitched tent. We hadn’t set an alarm because neither
of us was in a hurry to be confronted with the mess we’re in. Slowly, slowly
we’re having breakfast today. Slowly we’re getting changed, it’s close to 9am
already. Reluctantly, Conni leaves the tent first for brushing her teeth –
and all of a sudden she’s enjoying the view, the surreal surroundings, the ash
she’s standing in. Looking out to the West over the black giants in her way she
feels bold and optimistic. There are only 4km between us and the western edge of
this forsaken glacier. It will need a bit more than a hell of ice and ash to
make us turn around now! Oh how a good night’s sleep can change the world.
Somehow, sleeping like babies right in the middle of, in fact, right on top of
our fears and doubts made them go away. With expert eyes we’re now scanning
the mountain ranges that stretch out to both sides in front of us.
Sighting a slight decrease in height and softer slopes of the ice
pyramids further up the glacier gives us enough confidence.

We pack our stuff, roll up the tent and there isn’t even a long discussion.
"What do you think? Should we try again 1km north from here?" asks Fabien and
off we go. We leave the Black Forest to take the ash highway running in parallel.
We cover the distance northward in no time and almost immediately find a
friendly pass leading us over the first row of ash mountains. And the second row.
Conni can’t stop grinning. What looked intimidating to us yesterday is now
something that we feel can easily be climbed. The crevasses are smaller,
allowing lateral search for suitable passages. Climbing up the big ridge over
there? Not a big deal today. The shapes of the ice mountains often resemble
miniature copies of their bigger counterparts made of stone. We wiggle through
ice valleys, water carving blue rivers with black banks of ash. Without any
difficulties we’re passing the third row of black mountains, sliding down its
ashy slope on the western side. Conni has tears of joy in her eyes - we made it!
We made it!! Fabien doesn’t want to make the mistake of too much optimism again
and reminds her that we’re not off the glacier yet. Conni doesn’t care.
From now, she is sure,  it’ll be a piece of cake!

And it is.
Easily bouncing up and down the beloved ice bumps, parallel to crevasses,
we reach the western edge of Skeiðarárjökull. Throwing off her crampons, Conni
lets off cries of victory. There you go, you monster!!
We escaped, you couldn’t hold us back!

Finally we can continue our way on solid ground, passing what is left of the glacier lake Graenalon. This huge lake lost most of its water due to the retreat of the glacier, opening the barrier and giving way to an almost complete discharge along the western side of the glacier.

What is left are high terraces of sand indicating past lake levels, like a staircase for giants dominating this landscape.
With the euphoria of the successful glacier traverse fading, Conni has time to find new reasons to worry. “You know what”, she says, “I think now we’ll be trapped between a hell of a glacier and a hell of a glacier river. You’ll see.” And yes, that’s what we would see.
Following footsteps of mountain guide groups along the Graenalon banks we can already see the river that would be cause of the arguably most dangerous situation on this trip.

Innocently glittering in the sunshine, we see it fanning out in several big streams in what used to be the lake. We knew we would have to cross it somewhere - this would have been our moment to cross it where it’s spread out and in a wide flat terrain. But that would’ve meant to climb down all those giant stairs - and up again. In addition it was hard to tell whether the old lakebed might be muddy to the degree of sinking in.

    <figcaption>The slopes on our right are very dry, but the smallest
    source of water creates beautiful oases.</figcaption>
</figure>

In any case, we trust our GPS track (and some footsteps here and there), which suggests that this river can be crossed further upstream. So we go several kilometres and quite a few hours further upstream - but of course the river doesn’t become any friendlier.
As we arrive at the point of river crossing according to our map and GPS, we’re standing in an area where the river is deeply carved into a small valley with mostly steep slopes and only very few points that would allow a crossing at all (if you planned to actually be able to get out of the river). Oh how we missed that sick feeling in our stomach.
We walk up and down our new grey-murky gurgling obstacle, not able to enjoy the tumbling masses of water in the rapids, let alone the cascade right behind the would-be crossing point. The sound of a river usually tells you what to expect when trying to cross it and the sound of this glacier river pretty clearly stated “stay away”.

We instantly decide to camp on the river bank. At least there would be less water in the morning and we absolutely don’t feel like dealing with a problem of that margin the same day we survived the glacier. It’s pretty clear to us by now that this tour would be a constant problem solving. The uneasy feeling of not knowing what kind of crazy obstacle comes next would be our constant companion. Of course, the fact that we have no cellphone reception out here and couldn’t call for help if anything happened doesn’t ease the tension in that context.

We try to make friends with the river by going for a sponge bath and testing our neoprene socks. Conni doesn’t want to think about tomorrow for now and keeps herself busy with stitching up holes in her trousers (bloody crampons) whilst sitting in the sun by the tent. Let’s hope this river looks completely different in the morning..  


### Map of the glacier traverse

    <figcaption>We knew from the hiking map that the guides now traverse the
    Black Forest much more to the North (orange line) than Dieter Graser did
    in 2006 (pink). We found it basically impossible to cross at the location
    suggested by both tracks, unless maybe by chance. Our solution (walking
    at least 1km North than the suggested track) turned out to be quite
    good.</figcaption>
