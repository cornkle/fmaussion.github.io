Last summer my partner [Conni](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/staff/cornelia-klein)
and I spent three weeks in Iceland. One of our goals was to walk a trek
we had read about on the
[Icelandic Guides portfolio](https://www.mountainguides.is/multi-day-tours/backpacking-tours/backpacking-along-vatnajoekull-combination/).
Apart from their succinct description of the guided tour we could find
little information about the trail, the most comprehensive reports being
that of [Dieter Graser's](http://www.isafold.de/graenalon06/default.htm) (in German)
and [David Abadie's](http://www.bigfootenislande.fr) (in French) very useful websites.
From their stories we knew that the trek wouldn't be an easy
endeavor. We'd have to do some serious glacier and river crossings and we would
have to navigate in wild, untouched landscapes.

The trek fulfilled all our expectations: it was a truly wild adventure rewarded
with wonderful, magical landscapes that we had to share with no other
(we didn't see any other human being during the seven days of our trip).

**Disclaimer**: *We decided to write a description of our itinerary here,
and trekkers might find this information useful. However, we'd like to
emphasize that this information is given with no warranty and that this trek
should not be taken lightly. The walk isn't technically difficult, but is
remote and engaged. The conditions in Iceland are very variable, and
the glacier and river crossings can be significantly more challenging in bad
weather conditions. The glacier traverse, in particular, has changed
considerably in comparison to Dieter Graser's description in
2006 and the accelerated melting of the glacier won't make things easier in
the future.*
